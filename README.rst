onegov.municipality
===================

This is a Plone policy package, setting up a `OneGov Box`_ based
website for municipalities.


Releases
--------

The `OneGov Box`_ comes with a Known Good Set of packages which can be found
in the release folder of this repo. There's currently no stable release.

Stable releseas are versions without appendage like rc1 or dev. 1.0 or 1.0.1
for example.

Once a Known Good Set is released, it will not be changed anymore, so it is
safe to use that set for production.

The latest.cfg in the releases folder always contains the latest pinned
packages.
