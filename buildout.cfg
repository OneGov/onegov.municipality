       # seantis.reservation supports multiple database connections on a single
       # zope instance. Each site on an instance may have its own connection.

       # this can be configured by using absolute values:

       # dsn-mysite postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/mysite
       dsn ${onegov:reservations-database}

       # where dsn-mysite is the dsn for the site with the id 'mysite' and
       # where dsn is the default dsn for all other sites (must be present)

       # alternatively a wildcard may be used:

       # dsn postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/{*}

       # here, {*} is replaced by the site id and will result in the following
       # dsn strings for the sites mysite and yoursite:

       # mysite:
       # postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/mysite

       # yoursite:
       # postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/yoursite
